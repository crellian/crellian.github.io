I'm an MSCS student from [Thomas Lord Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.usc.edu/), [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/). I'm intereseted in computer vision, robot visual navigation and robot manipulation with multi-modal prompts. My current research is about empowering intelligent robots with pre-trained foundational models. 

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Laurent Itti](http://ilab.usc.edu/itti/) of iLab at USC.
You can find my CV here: [Chen's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Chen_Liu_Resume.pdf).

[World model-based Sim2Real Transfer for Robot Visual Navigatio](https://sites.google.com/usc.edu/world-model-sim2real)
--------
Chen Liu*, Kiran Lekkala*, Laurent Itti
*Preprint. Under Review.*

We propose a robust system that integrates a control policy, trained within a simulator, with an internal LSTM-based world model and an external visual perception model, facilitating seamless application of the policy in real-world scenarios.

Real-world Robot Visual Navigation in a Simulator: A New Benchmark
---------
HengHui Bao*, Kiran Lekkala*, Chen Liu, Laurent Itti
*Preprint. Under Review.*

We collect a large augmented dataset comprising panoramic RGB images annotated with pose stamps and developed a simulator that allows for seamless evaluation of reinforcement learning methods on robot visual navigation tasks.
