I'm an MSCS student from [Thomas Lord Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.usc.edu/), [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/). I'm intereseted in computer vision, robot visual navigation and robot manipulation with multi-modal prompts. My current research is about empowering intelligent robots with pre-trained foundational models. 

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Laurent Itti](http://ilab.usc.edu/itti/) of iLab at USC.
You can find my CV here: [Chen's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Chen_Liu_Resume.pdf).
