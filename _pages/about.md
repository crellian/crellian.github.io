I'm an MSCS student from [Thomas Lord Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.usc.edu/), [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/). My research interest includes robotics, computer vision, vision-language model, and robot manipulation.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Laurent Itti](http://ilab.usc.edu/itti/) of iLab from [School of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/), Peking University.
You can find my CV here: [Chen's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
